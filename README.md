I used a docker-compose.yaml to run pyspark local, but this pipeline could easilly run at EMR using its notebook, or you can run as a pipeline using EMR cluster steps (bute code type should be script).

To run the project you must have docker-compose installed on your machine, then just run docker-compose up on the project origin.

Any doubts? Open a github issue or email me - I will be happy to answer you shortly!
